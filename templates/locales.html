    <p> Each user should be able to see the full list of locales. 
    <p> The form below should check to see if the locale entered exists in the locales table. 
        <ol>
            <li>If it does, and the linked userID is NULL, there is no one currently there, so the users_in_locales table should be updated accordingly.</li>
            <li>If the linked userID matches the current user's ID, this should return an error, letting them know we are already aware they are at that location.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it should add the locale to the locales table, and add the userID & locale to the users_in_locales table, and generate a success message.</li>
