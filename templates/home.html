<h2>Pages</h2>
<h4>Register</h4>
<p><i>If the locale provided is already present in the in the UsersLocales table, the user should not be permitted to register with that localeName.</i></p>
<p>The registration page adds a new user to the Users table -- firstName, lastName, and an autoincremented userID. If the locale provided is not yet in the Locales table, it is added -- localeName and an autoincremented localeID. Finally, an entry is added to the UsersLocales table linking the user and locale.</p>

<h4>Login</h4>
<p>The login page uses a select statement to find the user's userID (based on the first and last name they logged in with), which is used to find the user's name, locale, and upcoming and available walks and activities.</p>

<h4>Quarpedia</h4>
<p>This is the user's main page, where they can see their current activity.</p>
To change any of this content, the user needs to navigate to other links:
<ul>
	<li>locales to add locales</li>
	<li>walks to change the user's current locale</li>
	<li>activities to add activities to do</li>
</ul>

<h4>Locales</h4>
<p>This is simply the locales table. New locales can be added here.</p>

<h4>Walks</h4>
<p>Walks inserts to UsersLocales by providing the user with a dropdown of destinations they can reserve. These (locales) are filtered to only locales no one else is currently at (locales not in UsersLocales). This also results in a delete of the current UserLocale relationship.</p>

<h4>Activities</h4>
<p>Activities inserts to UsersLocales by providing the user with a dropdown of destinations they can reserve. These (locales) are filtered to only locales no one else is currently at (locales not in UsersLocales). This also results in a delete of the current UserLocale relationship.</p>
