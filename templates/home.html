<h2>Pages</h2>
<h4>Register</h4>
<p>The registration page adds a new user to the Users table.</p>
<p>If the locale provided is not yet in the Locales table, it is added here.</p>
<p>Finally, an entry is added to the UsersInLocales table.</p>
<p>The form must have a constraint to only allow for locales that don't currently have users to be added by new users.</p>

<h4>Login</h4>
<p>The login page uses a select statement to find the userID, which is used to find the user's name, locale, and upcoming and available walks and activities.</p>

<h4>Quarpedia</h4>
<p>This is the user's main page, where they can see their current activity.</p>
<p>To change any of this content, the user needs to navigate to other links:
<ul>
	<li>locales in order to add a new place to walk to</li>
	<li>walks to update locale</li>
	<li>activities to add activities to do</li>
</ul>
